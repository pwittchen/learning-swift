==============
Repository created in order to learn some basics of Swift programming language

Installing Swift on Linux
-------------------------

```bash
# get snapshot of Swift
$ wget https://swift.org/builds/ubuntu1404/swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-01-b/swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-01-b-ubuntu14.04.tar.gz
# unpack downloaded snapshot
$ tar -xzvf *.gz
```

open your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in `$HOME` directory and add the `bin/` directory of Swift to the `$PATH` system variable as follows:

```
export PATH=your/path/to/swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-01-b-ubuntu14.04/usr/bin/
```

Type:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```

and then:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake ninja-build clang uuid-dev libicu-dev icu-devtools libbsd-dev libedit-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev swig libpython-dev libncurses5-dev pkg-config
```

After that, close terminal, open it again ant type:

```
$ swift --version
```

You should get output like that:

```
Swift version 2.2-dev (LLVM 46be9ff861, Clang 4deb154edc, Swift 778f82939c)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Swift console
-------------

In terminal, you can type:

```
swift
```

and play with the console:

```swift
>1 print("Hello, Swift!")
>2 41 + 1
>3 import Glibc
>4 random()
```

Sample programs
---------------

Directory named `tasks/` contains sample programs. Separate directories with programs contains `Makefile`, which can be used for compiling and running the programs. To compile and run programs, go to a specific directory and just type `make`.
